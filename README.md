Simple managing application for a small trucking logistics company.

## What does it do
The application covers the management of clients, routes and tractors, as well as simple billing.
Data are stored in a small MySQL database in the server so far; the volume of data creation is under 100MB/year.
The war file is deployed in a Tomcat, so users get a web interface deployed in their private network.
There is a database dump executed weekly to prevent massive data loss.

## Success case
Before the application, the company had to spend 3 full days of two employees to cover the billing of a month.
With this application, the company managed to reduce that time to half a day of one employee.
The company also got unexpected side benefits: a reduction of over 60% in paper usage and easier traceability of its inner processes.
